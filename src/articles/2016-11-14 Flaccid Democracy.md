I must confess I was never much interested into politics, and therefore very grateful when I 
found the [Wahl-o-mat] which freed me from having to read the party platforms myself. I always
viewed the industry as the more effective, certainly more efficient way for changing society and
have been pondering for years how the markets incentives can be moved towards a more social and sustainable
economy. Indeed I always thought of politics to be quite tedious, boring even. I now realized what a luxury 
that was.

I the world in a crisis? Is democracy in a crisis? It's probably too early to say but it sure seems that way. It
seems to be getting from bad to worse to absolute worst. First the success of right-wing parties in eastern Europe, 
then the formation and partial success of a new nationalist party in Germany, then Brexit (what a stupid word) and
now Trump.

Why is this happening. I don't know and I haven't seen a satisfying answer yet. But I have a theory.

## Democratic Debt

What is democracy? It's "power of the people". That means that "the people" are (or should be) in charge of the 
government. All of them. And since that's not feasible yet, all current implementations use a system of more or 
less directly appointed delegates. So the way I understand it is this: The more directly "the people" can influence 
the law of a country, the more democratic is that country.

Scrum -> Democracy
Technical Practices -> Education
Technical Debt -> Educational Debt
Bankruptcy -> Minority Rule

=> we need to put more focus on education

Especially we need to learn about
- cognitive biases
- compassion
- constructive discussion
- critical thinking
- scientific method
