I must confess I was never much interested into politics, and therefore very grateful when I 
found the [Wahl-o-mat] which freed me from having to read the party platforms myself. I always
viewed the industry as the more effective, certainly more efficient way for changing society and
have been pondering for years how the markets incentives can be moved towards a more social and sustainable
economy. Indeed I always thought of politics to be quite tedious, boring even. I now realized what a luxury 
that was.

I the world in a crisis? Is democracy in a crisis? It's probably too early to say but it sure seems that way. It
seems to be getting from bad to worse to absolute worst. First the success of right-wing parties in eastern Europe, 
then the formation and partial success of a new nationalist party in Germany, then Brexit (what a stupid word) and
now Trump.

Why is this happening? I don't know and I haven't seen a satisfying answer yet. But I have a theory.

## Technical Debt

When I saw what is happening in democratic countries I experienced a familiar feeling. I was still very much convinced
that the system is not to blame. But still something went clearly wrong. It was the same feeling that I had when I saw
or read about software development teams that were unhappy with "Agile" and are convinced that it "failed" them.

What I saw again and again in these teams was something that Martin Fowler calls [Flaccid Scrum]. Said teams usually only adopted the managing practices of the method they were following without following the technical practices. And they fail because the one thing doesn't work without the other. Not for long at least.

What happens is that if you decide to just release more ofter and to be more flexible about the requirements and just generally speaking "go faster", it's crucial that your code base actually lets you do all of these things. For that it has to be *clean* enough. It has to be refactored constantly to avoid becoming a dump.

The growing dump doesn't hinder you much in the beginning and you actually start to become faster but after a while, the growing amount of ad-hoc solutions make it harder and harder to extend the system and you grind to a halt.

Keeping the code base clean requires skills and, maybe more importantly, discipline. (If you lack discipline, give TDD a try.) It's much like keeping your kitchen sink clean while cooking. It's not as much fun as releasing features, but it's absolutely necessary. Otherwise you will create what Ward Cunningham called [Technical Debt]. And just like financial debt, it can be a useful tool, but it can also make you bancrupt.

This is what I believe is happening in many democratic countries.

## Power and Knowledge

What is democracy? It's "power of the people". That means that "the people" are (or should be) in charge of the 
government. All of them. And since that's not feasible yet, all current implementations use a system of more or 
less directly appointed delegates. So the way I understand it is this: The more directly "the people" can influence 
the law of a country, the more democratic is that country.

And of course what you really want is that whoever is in charge of your country should be able to make good decisions. How you define "good" is of course another question all together. In my opinion "happiness" is still a much better metric than "money spent" but that's not what I want to talk about here.

What "being able to make good decisions" definitely means nowadays being able to understand complex problems. Because most problems nowadays are quite complex. And the way to achieve that of course is through educatuon. Jeffersons put this more eloquently:

> I know no safe depository of the ultumate powers of the society but the people themselves. And if we thunj them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform their discretion by education.


## Democratic Debt

My theory is this: Ignoring the mandate for education but still demanding that the people should be in charge is essentially the same as ignoring the need to clean-up your codebase but demand to spit features out every two weeks.

What we have created is a Democratic Debt. Too many people lack the essential skills to recognise good decisions. They don't vote with an understanding of the complex problems that have to tackled. Instead they let themselves guide by emotions, believes and partisan solidarity. And I'm not talking about reading or maths skills here or a knowledge or hostoric events. The skills that a democratic citizen needs and that I haven't seen on any curriculum yet are

- feeling compassion
- having a constructive discussion
- exercising critical thinking
- applying the scientific method
- avoiding cognitive biases

“Being able to read a warning on a pill bottle or write about a summer vacation is not literacy and our society should not treat it so. Literacy, for example, is being able to fluently read and follow the 50-page argument in [Thomas] Paine’s Common Sense and being able (and happy) to fluently write a critique or defense of it.” (Maxwell, p. 137)

So instead of fighting the ignorants and their followers, let's put our energy towards creating a better education for the next generation but also for the current ones. Let's rethink if curricula with arbitrary standardized learning achievements are really the best way to motivate people. Let's reconsider if stuffing people into groups solely by their birth year is the best enviornment for them to learn. And let's find out if we can create something better that static, linear media to express and explore their ideas in.

> It is not education, but educatuon of a certain kind that will serve us. And the current model of western, urban-centered, school-based educatuon, which is so oftern more focused on turning children into coroorate units rather than curious snd open-minded adults, will only lead us further down the wrong path.
