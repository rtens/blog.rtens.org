While I'm not a fan of certifications and the sort, it's definitely helpful for a novice developer to have a scale to measure himself against. Something that answers the question "what do I need to learn?"

The guys from [clean-code-developer.de] do a decent job of defining stages and methods to assert yourself. I would suggest to anyone to try to follow it for a while. It's harder than it seems. 

When it comes to PHP development, there is also [phptherightway.com] with a nice collection of best practices and tools. Anyway, this is how my list of skills and tools would look like:

1. Version Control System ([subversion], [git], [github])
2. Testing (phpunit, tdd, [bdd])
3. Debugging (xdebug)
4. Dependency Management ([composer], [packagist])
5. Best Practices ([clean code]/[r][clean coder], [design patterns], [beautiful code])
