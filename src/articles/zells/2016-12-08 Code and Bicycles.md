Status: draft

One of the most inspiring texts that I've ever read is Bret Victor's [What can a technologist do about climate change][climateChange]. Before reading it, I was always a bit ashamed of not spending my energy directly on this most urgent and extensive problem of humanity. Instead of working on alternative energy sources, storage or distribution, I was solving comparatively small and trivial problems.

Victor's words motivated me to think about how I can use my knowledge, skills and passion to help mitigating the global climate change, even if somewhat indirectly. I determined that the field I'm most knowledgeable in is computing and software engineering and my skills to be system analysis, software design and teaching. And the thing I'm most passionate about is this idea of a computing model that has been floating around in my head for several years but that I never dared to take seriously, apart from writing my [diploma thesis][thesis] about it.

So earlier this year, I used a two-week stay in a Buddhist monastery to think hard about what it is that drives me, why I couldn't get that computing platform idea out of my head and what the root problem might be that I want to solve with it. The result is a [manifesto] and the conviction that my mission should be **to augment the collective intelligence of humanity by Increasing _Software Literacy_**.

## Learn to Code

When I started looking for others who might share this mission, I found dozens of on-line as well as off-line courses that all make a very similar promise: to transform you into a software developer in a couple of weeks or months. Of many I've heard before but never really had a closer look. So I dug into a couple of them and was surprised to realize that something didn't feel right. There was something about their approach that irked me but I couldn't put my finger on it.

In a broad generalization, the usual process was that you choose a programming language and then do guided tasks of increasing difficulty that are automatically evaluated. The tasks were of the kind that a recruiter might use to asses an applicant's familiarity with a technology. Some courses have an instant gratification system that rewards you with batches for reaching certain levels.

Having written *Software Literacy* on my banner I was frustrated that I couldn't completely get behind this *Learn to Code* movement and even more so that I couldn't argue what bothered me about these courses. They just seemed to be focusing on the wrong thing.


## Learn to Bike

And once again it was Alan Kay describing in a [talk about CS eduction][talk] exactly what I was feeling. But once again I did not understand his message right away and I didn't connect the dots until I replied to a [comment on HackerNews][hackernews] that was part of the feedback to said manifesto.

I never thought about how different the experience of learning how to ride a bicycle must be for children nowadays compared to how I learned it. Just suddenly these tiny balance bikes seemed to be very much in vogue and I remember being surprised by how young their riders sometimes were and how well they handled it. But I just though "neat" and didn't see the didactic implications. Of course somebody would somehow have to learn to bike twice in their life to really know, but the difference must be enormous.
 
This seems to be a very intuitive and common approach when teaching something to children: Take the adult version of something, and change something so it's less likely to fail. The problem is that many times, this change destroys the essence of what you want to teach. On a bike with training wheels, it's impossible to learn the one skill you need for riding an actual bike: balancing.


## Don't learn to code
