I realized that I regularly write logs for myself for keepsake. But they mostly turn out too short and cryptic to understand - given that I actually find them again. So I guess this blog is mostly for myself, but who knows - maybe someone else might find this stuff interesting. 

My last blog about [my time living in Valencia][vlc] had basically the same purpose and it's still a nice memory. This one is probably gonna be mostly about software engineering but we'll see.
