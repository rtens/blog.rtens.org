So what is my principle?

Finding a guiding principle for your work

Bret: Creators need immediate connection with their creation

"Bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important thing that people do."

Ideas are precious to him. They can't come out if they don't have the right environment. They die.

Why: "When I see a violation of this principle. I don't think of that as an opportunity to make a product. I'm not excited by finding a problem to solve."

"Ideas are very previous to me. And when I see ideas die, it hurts. I see a tragedy. To me it feels like a moral wrong. It feels like an injustice. And if I think there is anything I can do about it, I feel it's my responsibility to do so. Not opportunity, but responsibility."

Larry Tesler: No modes.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton: Women should vote.
Doug Engelbart: Enable mankind to solve the world's urgent problems
Alan Kay: Amplify human reach and bring new ways of thinking to a faltering civilization that desperately needed it
Richard Stallman: Software must be free, as in freedom

"Now I'm not saying you have to live this way. I'm not saying that you should live this way. What I'm saying is that you can."

"So, you can choose this life. Or maybe it will end up choosing you. It might not happen right away. It can take time to find a principle because finding a principle is essentially a form of self-discovery, that you're trying to figure out what your life is supposed to be about. What you want to stand for as a person. Took me like a decade."

"And finally, if you choose to follow a principle, a principle can't just be any old thing you believe in. Larry Tesler['s principle] is a powerful principle because it gave him a new way of seeing the world. It divided the world in right and wrong in a fairly objective way. So, he could look at somebody selecting text and ask: Is this person in a mode? Yes or no? If yes, he had to do something about that."

"There are many ways to live your life. That's maybe the most important thing you can realize in your life, is that every aspect of your life is a choice. But there are default choices. You can choose to sleepwalk through your life and accept the path that's been laid out for you. You can choose to accept the world as it is. But you don't have to. If there is something in the world you feel is a wrong and you have a vision for what a better world could be, you can find your guiding principle. And you can fight for a cause. So after this talk, I'd like you to take a little time and think about what matters to you. What you believe in. And what you might fight for."
