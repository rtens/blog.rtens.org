How do you live your life? Why did you make the decisions you made? How do you want to live you life? What do you want to stand for as a person? These are not the usual questions that you might ask yourself while listening to a talk at a technical conference. Unless you are listening to [Bret Victor]. In [*Inventing on Principle*][video] (transcript [here][transcript]) he talks about nothing less than the most important question of all: What do I want to do with my life?

## Choices

> There are many ways to live your life. What's maybe the most important thing you can realize in your life, is that every aspect of your life is a choice.

This is from the end of his talk but for me it's the most important lesson in it. It sounds trivial, but most people I know don't believe that. They are firmly convinced that their lives are the way they are mostly because of their circumstances. I hear things like "Of course I have to work in this terrible job, I'm not rich enough to do what I enjoy." or "How am I supposed to find a girlfriend when I ugly?".

But really everything is a choice. If something doesn't go the way you want, you have usually a couple of options to change them. They are probably scary and require some determination, but they are always worth it. The first attempt will fail. And so the second and third. But if you learn, adapt and persist, the chances of eventually reaching even your most daring goal are pretty good. You are in charge of your circumstances. Not the other way around.

But you're probably pretty happy with your life. Or at least content. Everything is going more or less the way you've planned. But is that really true? Did you ever consider the choices you *didn't* make? The choices you didn't even see? If you could go back in time and tell the 10-year-old you what your life turned out to be like, would you get excited? Victor warns:

> There are default choices. You can choose to sleepwalk through your life and accept the path that's been laid out for you. You can choose to accept the world as it is. But you don't have to.

## Bret's Principle

> If there is something in the world you feel is a wrong and you have a vision for what a better world could be, you can find your guiding principle. And you can fight for a cause. So after this talk, I'd like you to take a little time and think about what matters to you. What you believe in. And what you might fight for.

> Ideas are very important to me. I think that bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important things that people do. And I think that great ideas, in the form of great art, stories, inventions, scientific theories, these things take on lives of their own, which give meaning to our lives as people. So, I think a lot about how people create ideas and how ideas grow. And in particular, what sorts of tools create a healthy environment for ideas to grow.

Creators need immediate connection with their creation

> Bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important thing that people do.

> When I see a violation of this principle. I don't think of that as an opportunity to make a product. I'm not excited by finding a problem to solve.

> Ideas are very previous to me. And when I see ideas die, it hurts. I see a tragedy. To me it feels like a moral wrong. It feels like an injustice. And if I think there is anything I can do about it, I feel it's my responsibility to do so. Not opportunity, but responsibility.


## Larry's Principle

Larry Tesler: No modes.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton: Women should vote.
Doug Engelbart: Enable mankind to solve the world's urgent problems
Alan Kay: Amplify human reach and bring new ways of thinking to a faltering civilization that desperately needed it
Richard Stallman: Software must be free, as in freedom

> If you choose to follow a principle, a principle can't just be any old thing you believe in. Larry Tesler['s principle] is a powerful principle because it gave him a new way of seeing the world. It divided the world in right and wrong in a fairly objective way. So, he could look at somebody selecting text and ask: Is this person in a mode? Yes or no? If yes, he had to do something about that.

Example for violations of that principle


## Your Principle

> So, you can choose this life. Or maybe it will end up choosing you. It might not happen right away. It can take time to find a principle because finding a principle is essentially a form of self-discovery, that you're trying to figure out what your life is supposed to be about. What you want to stand for as a person. Took me like a decade.

> I'm not saying you have to live this way. I'm not saying that you should live this way. What I'm saying is that you can.
