I read "[The Lean Startup](book)" by Eric Ries a couple of weeks ago and was deeply impressed. The main idea of the book is the apply the scientific method to business development which Ries calls *validated learning*. Instead of doing a dozen things and give oneself a pat on the back if the numbers go up (or blaming everyone else if they go down), validated learning requires to *proof* that what you do has a positive effect of the business. Suddenly being able to perform controlled experiments becomes very important. Why not put your version control system on the job?
