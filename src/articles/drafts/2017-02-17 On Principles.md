>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


In high school, I was oftentimes mocked for caring too much about principles. Saying things like "This is against my principles" or "I'm doing this out of principle" earns you quite bit of ridicule from fellow teenagers. And even today, I still get scoffed at when I'm one of the few cyclists in this city that stops at a red light. Out of principle.

So I wasn't too surprised when [Bret Victor]'s talk [*Inventing on Principle*][video] resonated deeply with me. I'm all about principles. But yet, I never looked for one in my work. Not of the kind that Victor talks about at least. But I got the feeling that there might be one.

## Choices

How do you live your life? How do you want to live you life? Why did you make the decisions you made? What do you want to stand for as a person? These are not the usual questions that you hear in a talk at a technical conference. But in this talk (transcript [here][transcript]), Victor speaks about nothing less than the question of all questions: What do I want to do with my life?

This is already the [second time][global warming] that Victor has depply inspired me with his words. But I can't remember another presentation that moved as much as this one. He ends it with a truth that is as important and universal as it is simple. It's a liberating realization that yet many people refuse to accept.

> There are many ways to live your life. What's maybe the most important thing you can realize in your life, is that every aspect of your life is a choice. But there are default choices. You can choose to sleepwalk through your life and accept the path that's been laid out for you. You can choose to accept the world as it is. But you don't have to.

That sounds a lot like the usual "quit your job", "follow your dreams" and "listen to your heart" kind of talks. But Victor goes down another path. Instead of letting your economic interests or your heart guide your decisions, he suggests to discover a *principle*. In his words:

> If there is something in the world you feel is a wrong and you have a vision for what a better world could be, you can find your guiding principle. And you can fight for a cause. So after this talk, I'd like you to take a little time and think about what matters to you. What you believe in. And what you might fight for.

## The Pain

I followed his advice and looked for things in the world that I consider "a wrong" and where I see a moral obligation to change them. I started to take better notice of all the little things that hurt me to watch. Just like it hurts Victor when he sees an idea die or like it hurts Larry Tesler when he sees someone stuck in a mode.

One thing that came into my mind immediately was the sting I feel when I see a screenshot of a text on Twitter. That hurts. Or pictures of graphs on websites. That hurts as well. Also the fact that I have to copy a picture in order to share it with a friend or rely on a third party service to share my files or do simple surveys. I even need a third party just to get a reminder about emails I haven't got a reply to yet. 

I feel pain when I think about how an international consortium decides what pictograms I can text to my mom. Or about how much work goes into making a website work on all browsers and platforms. Every time I see someone struggle with file formats - be it video, graphics or formatted text - it hurts. And it hurts when I'm forced to export something as PDF. Or when I have to download a CSV from one service just to upload it again to another. Although you could argue that that's almost amazing *if* that's possible at all. 

Because what hurts even more is when my own content is locked away from me. And the worst pain I feel when I read stories about people loosing all their content because Facebook suspended their accounts without giving a proper reason. It hurts when a million passwords get stolen, that are lot of them can be used for the email adresses that can reset them, and that that's usually enough to steal an entire identity. I also hate spam.

It hurts that I have to download an app on my phone just to do one simple thing. And that I have to uninstall another app first because I'm running out of space. And that I have to give it unrevocable blannket permissions to access my files or camera. It hurts that I have 12 different messaging apps installed in order to talk to people. And last, I cringe every time I have to manually restart my WiFi when the connection fails for no obvious reason.


## The Vision

I couldn't really infer a principle frome these pain points. And I don't enjoy focussing too much on the negatives anyway. So I also looked at my own work and at things that have inspired me for some more clues.

Bret Victor is certainly high up on my personal list of inspirations. Especially his interactive essays and demo of highly interactive authoring tools. The most interactive authoring tools I have at my disposal is certainly Smalltalk. Everything about it is highly inspirational, along with pretty much everything Alan Kay utters. Another thing that comes to mind is Paul Chiusano's take on [The Future of Software] and Ted Nelson's ideas about data structures. I'm also very much inspired by the One Laptop Per Child project and how the XO-1 and C.H.I.P. computers let you look under the hood. Or how Richard Pawson's Naked Object allow the user to directly interact with the domain model.

My own work has lately evolved around Domain-Driven Design, Command/Query Responsibility Segregation, Event Sourcing, Specification by Example (aka Behaviour-Driven Development), Ubiquitous Language and collaborative domain modelling. I built a user interface generator that is quite similar to Pawson's approach but is based on commands and queries instead of entities. I used it for a couple of prototypes and it was very helpful with debugging the domain model since it allowed me to give users direct access to the model early on.

And most importantly, last September I defrosted "zells" and sine then dedicated as much time as I can afford to it. Its goal is to enable software literacy by making creating, understanding, manipulating and sharing software much more accessible. It's a software plattform with a minimal programming model. Basically it's a mix of Kay's, Victor's and Nelson's and other ideas and a lot of fun to work on.

## Bret's Principle

Larry Tesler: No modes.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton: Women should vote.
Doug Engelbart: Enable mankind to solve the world's urgent problems
Alan Kay: Amplify human reach and bring new ways of thinking to a faltering civilization that desperately needed it
Richard Stallman: Software must be free, as in freedom
Bret Victor: 

> If you choose to follow a principle, a principle can't just be any old thing you believe in. Larry Tesler['s principle] is a powerful principle because it gave him a new way of seeing the world. It divided the world in right and wrong in a fairly objective way. So, he could look at somebody selecting text and ask: Is this person in a mode? Yes or no? If yes, he had to do something about that.




## My Principle


...

Inspired by Tesler's "No modes", my principle could be expressed as

> No UI


- domin
- naked objects
- tdd
- bdd
- modelling
- brining the user closer to the model

<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I asked myself: What is my principle? I could think of a couple. Some formed out of laziness, some are more reflected. Most are not very important to me. But there is one that stands out. One I that's worth fighting for. One that I'm willing to dedicate my life to.

It's like Victor describes it. Whenever I see this principle violated, it hurts me. I see it as a moral wrong and as my responsibility to do something about it. It's in a way what I've been writing about in my last couple of articles but I've never tried to put it directly into words. So here's my attempt.

I see computers as an incredibly powerful medium for ideas and I'm convinced they have the potential to bring about the next cognitive revolution. Like the printing press did for reading and writing, we need something to democratize software literacy, the ability to express and understand ideas in sofware. So my principle is that everybody should have cheap, direct and unrestricted access to the full power of computing.

----------------------




------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is from the end of his talk but for me it's the most important lesson in it. It sounds trivial, but most people I know don't believe that. They are firmly convinced that their lives are the way they are mostly because of their circumstances. I hear things like "Of course I have to work in this terrible job, I'm not rich enough to do what I enjoy." or "How am I supposed to find a girlfriend when I ugly?".

But really everything is a choice. If something doesn't go the way you want, you have usually a couple of options to change them. They are probably scary and require some determination, but they are always worth it. The first attempt will fail. And so the second and third. But if you learn, adapt and persist, the chances of eventually reaching even your most daring goal are pretty good. You are in charge of your circumstances. Not the other way around.

But you're probably pretty happy with your life. Or at least content. Everything is going more or less the way you've planned. But is that really true? Did you ever consider the choices you *didn't* make? The choices you didn't even see? If you could go back in time and tell the 10-year-old you what your life turned out to be like, would you get excited? Victor warns:

> But there are default choices. You can choose to sleepwalk through your life and accept the path that's been laid out for you. You can choose to accept the world as it is. But you don't have to.

## Bret's Principle

> If there is something in the world you feel is a wrong and you have a vision for what a better world could be, you can find your guiding principle. And you can fight for a cause. So after this talk, I'd like you to take a little time and think about what matters to you. What you believe in. And what you might fight for.

> Ideas are very important to me. I think that bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important things that people do. And I think that great ideas, in the form of great art, stories, inventions, scientific theories, these things take on lives of their own, which give meaning to our lives as people. So, I think a lot about how people create ideas and how ideas grow. And in particular, what sorts of tools create a healthy environment for ideas to grow.

Creators need immediate connection with their creation

> Bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important thing that people do.

> When I see a violation of this principle. I don't think of that as an opportunity to make a product. I'm not excited by finding a problem to solve.

> Ideas are very previous to me. And when I see ideas die, it hurts. I see a tragedy. To me it feels like a moral wrong. It feels like an injustice. And if I think there is anything I can do about it, I feel it's my responsibility to do so. Not opportunity, but responsibility.

## Your Principle

> So, you can choose this life. Or maybe it will end up choosing you. It might not happen right away. It can take time to find a principle because finding a principle is essentially a form of self-discovery, that you're trying to figure out what your life is supposed to be about. What you want to stand for as a person. Took me like a decade.

> I'm not saying you have to live this way. I'm not saying that you should live this way. What I'm saying is that you can.
