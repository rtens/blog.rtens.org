Somehow I thought that time would slow down a bit if I move to such a different place. But it didn't. Not a bit. A third of my time in Bhutan is already over - 121 days to go, 61 down. But I enjoyed every single one of it.


## Some Hikes

Especially the warm and sunny winter days, which are perfect for hiking up to the prayer flags to catch a wonderful view of my new home, Thimphu. Taking a short cut back through the woods turned out to be not such a great idea though since most trees and bushes here have thorns.

But that little excursion gave me appetite for a longer hike so on the next day we went up to the nearby monastery, Phojeding. After three hours marching uphill we reached a building complex that houses over 60 monks during the summer time, but only 7 monks stayed for the winter. By those were received with cookies and Naja - black tea with milk and plenty of sugar. A very young monk was eager to use the opportunity to practice his English and translated our conversation with one of the elders. On the way down I discovered that Bhutanese snowmen seem to have long pointy noses.

This hike also led to my first contribution to [OpenStreetMap] which I always use for hiking since in Germany the quality of the maps is incredible and I haven't found a single trail that was not also marked in them. Naturally, the amount of information for Bhutan is a lot less but still considerable at least concerning streets. I was positively surprised how easy it was to add [our path].

Unfortunately I haven't been to the mountains much since, partly because of weather, partly because a series of forest fires motivated us to stay away from the trees. During about three weeks, there were almost constantly something burning and the helicopter (the only one in the country) could be heard every other day. One day, the valley was filled with thick smoke caused by a major fire some ten kilometres away.

## Some Dance

A very rare treat for me was the opportunity to attend a *Puja* in the home village in Punakha of a good friend of my sister's. Pujas are religious ceremonies that almost every family does once per year and for special occasions like the birth of a child or a successful harvest. During two or three days, monks stay at the house, chanting and making music which sounds like something [this][puja]. I heard that sound almost every day when walking through Thimphu since Pujas are usually held during the two month winter vacation.

All 25 households of the village were invited, there was a lot of food and since I didn't want to be the only one using a spoons, I learned to eat rice and chilli with my hand which was harder than I thought.The trick is to squeeze the rice into a ball and then dip that into the chilli sauce. This also seems to be the reason why rice is always served and kept on a separate plate. I especially enjoyed the *Ara*, a rice wine which is a little sweeter than Sake and traditionally served hot mixed with fried egg.

Until late at night the villagers and monks danced and sang together. I didn't record it myself but [this video][dance] comes pretty close to what it sounded and looked like. While I was trying to learn the moves, one of the group from Thimphu that I was with informed me that we have been challenged to a rap battle by the youngsters. Unbelieving I came outside were a group of eight to fourteen year old were assembled and a little boy was indeed already rapping in Hindi while another was beatboxing. Luckily I still knew a couple of Blumentopf pieces by heart.

## Some Work

Back in Thimphu I started a new project at [drukhost], a local software development company. To kick-off the project, we did the probably first [event storming] workshop in Bhutan. The idea is to create a platform for Bhutanese movies about which you can currently only get very sparse information on facebook.

Another project I got quite excited about is to create tools for running complementary currencies. I wrote about this in my [previous article][money] and also created a [project homepage][groupcash]. I want to find a group to start a community currency in Thimphu but so far I have little more than an idea and am not sure if the remaining four months are enough time.

So I'm going almost every day to the office now where I keep warm with plenty of tea and work with two other guys on a website for Bhutanese movies. Going by bike is a lot of fun in the morning but the climbing the 300 metres elevation back up is quite an evening work-out.
