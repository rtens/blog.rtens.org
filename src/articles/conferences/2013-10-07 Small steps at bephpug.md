At the [Berlin PHP user group][bephpug] last week I had two "firsts". It was my first time live-coding and I thought while I'm at it I could also do a "live" presentation on my hybrid [tablet/netbook][t500]. Both went surprisingly well.

The talk has the name "Small Steps - the magic of TDD" and is basically about how test-driven development enables you to develop a programm taking one tiny step at a time. I put the "slides" and code [here][talk]. Let me know what you think.
