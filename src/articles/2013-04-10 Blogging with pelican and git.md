If it wasn't for [pelican], this blog would probably not exist. So here is a brief description on the why and what and how.

## Step 1: engine

The spark that got this blog going was my colleague showing me [pelican] yesterday which is a static blog generator written in [python]. This means that I can put my files and articles in whatever directory structure I fancy and generate the website as static files. The articles are written in a simple mark-up language (I use [markdown]) and annotated with meta-information. This has some nice advantages:

1. Speed and security
1. No internet access required (I sync across devices with [Dropbox])
1. No web editors (which annoy especially on the phone)
1. Adding custom static pages comes naturally
1. I kept a copy of my blog posts on my machine anyway

## Step 2: installation

I recently switched my web hosting to [uberspace] which offers all I could ever wish for and a surprising pricing model. You pay basically as much as you want with a minimum of 1â‚¬ per "space" and month. This makes it possible to have multiple accounts, which is perfect when having a bunch of independent projects as in my case. Thanks to my new hoster, installing and running pelican was easy:
	
	:::bash
	[remote]$ easy_install pelican markdown
	[remote]$ pelican

This generates an empty blog in an `output` directory.

## Step 3: configuration

Pelican works pretty well [out-of-the-box] but some configuration is eventually necessary. Here is my `config.py` with some comments.

	:::python
	from __future__ import unicode_literals

	# Information about myself
	AUTHOR = 'Nikolas Martens'
	SITENAME = "Nikolas.M@rtens"
	SITEURL = 'http://blog.rtens.org'
	TIMEZONE = "Europe/Berlin"
	GITHUB_URL = 'http://github.com/rtens/'
	SOCIAL = (('twitter', 'http://twitter.com/rtens_'),
	          ('github', 'http://github.com/rtens'),)

	# These two lines allow me to write my save my posts like 
	# "blog/articles/myCategory/2013-04-09 Some Title.md" and the category, date and 
	# title will be parsed automatically
	FILENAME_METADATA  = '(?P<date>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}) (?P<title>.*)'
	ARTICLE_DIR = ('articles/')

## Step 4: deployment

I wanted to be able to bring my blog online with [git] push

	:::bash
	[local]$ git push web

and found a nice [blog post][push-deploy] with instructions.

The first step is to create a bare repository on the host. it must be bare so we can push to it.

	:::bash
	[remote]$ mkdir blog.git && cd blog.git
	[remote]$ git init --bare

Then create and activate the post-receive hook

	:::bash
	[remote]$ cat > hooks/post-receive
	#!/bin/sh

	HOME=/home/rtens
	TMP=$HOME/tmp/blog
	OUT=$HOME/html/blog
	PELICAN=$HOME/bin/pelican

	echo "Checking-out working copy"
	rm -rf $TMP
	mkdir $TMP
	GIT_WORK_TREE=$TMP git checkout -f

	echo "Generating blog"
	$PELICAN -o $OUT -s $TMP/conf.py $TMP
	rm -rf $TMP

	echo "Done"

	[remote]$ chmod +x hooks/post-receive

Finally, on your local machine, create a repostory, add the remote one and push once

	:::bash
	[local]$ mkdir blog && cd blog
	[local]$ git init
	[local]$ git remote add web ssh://myhost.uberspace.de/home/rtens/blog.git
	[local]$ git add *
	[local]$ git push web master

That's all.
