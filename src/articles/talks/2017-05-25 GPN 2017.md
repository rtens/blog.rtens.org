The [Gulaschprogrammiernacht][GPN] (GPN) was my first deliberate journey into the hacker community and I have since been working hard on forgiving myself for not having gone every single year before. It was great fun just randomly talkin to people about their ideas and projects, trying out more VR headsets, playing experimental table top games and it was definitely the first time I drove a Club Mate crate.

I used the opportunity to tell as many people as possible about [zells] and also gave a [lightning talk] about it, which spawned many more interesting conversations. You can [watch the talk here][video].

Hope I will make it again to Karlsruhe next year.
