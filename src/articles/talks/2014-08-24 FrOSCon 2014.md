I was invited at this years [FrOSCon] to speak about executable documentation which is sort of follow-up to [last year][froscon8] where I spoke about [Specficiation by Example][sbe] (aka Behavior-Driven Development) and how to use automated tests to create a self-validating documentation of a software application. This year I approached the matter from the documentation side, transforming the documentation of [mockster] into an executable program (aka automated tests).

[You can find the slides here][slides]. And for the first time, there is also a [video of this talk][video] availble.

Anyway, I enjoyed a lot giving the talk, thanks to a very interested and engaging people listing who also gave [some][comment1] nice [feedback][comment2]. Thanks for that. I'm already looking forward to FrOSCon 2015.
