For my last conference of 2017 I travelled, as for the first of this year, to Amsterday to talk about [Specification by Example][sbe] (aka Behaviour-Driven Development) and the *Dutch PHP Conference*. I used to opportunity to revise the presentation and slides which you can find [here][slides].

Update: A video of the talk is now [available on youtube][video].
