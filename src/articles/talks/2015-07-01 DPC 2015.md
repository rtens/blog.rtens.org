Last weekend I had the extraordinary pleasure of presenting my talk on [Template Animation][tempan] at the [Dutch PHP Conference][dpc]. If you happened to attend: thanks for showing up although it was the first slot after the social event =) and also: I'd appreciate your [feedback].

The conference was extremely well organized, and I especially enjoyed the presentation by Ross Tuck on how [Awesome Command Busses]. Also, having two extra days for exploring Amsterdam turned out to be the best idea I had all year. Hope to be there again next year.
