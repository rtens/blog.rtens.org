I was very happy to get the opportunity to talk about **Rapid Prototyping with Domain-Driven Design** at the International PHP Conference in Berlin. You can find the revised version of my [slides here]. Unfortunately my agenda didn't allow me to attend many of the sessions but it was great meeting many friends from the PHP community again.

I was even asked to write an article about essential complexity which was [published on IPC's blog][blog].

So many thanks to the team for organizing a great conference!
