Last week I had the pleasure of presenting my talk on [Specification by Example][sbe] (aka Behaviour-Driven Development) at the [Codemotion] conference in Rome in front of a very attentive and responsive audience.

[You can find the slides here][slides] and some pics [here][tweet1] and [here][tweet2]. Thanks for those!

The talks I enjoyed the most were by [Bruce Lawson][brucel] and [Garrett Smith][gar1t]. Bruce managed to make listening to his presentation as enjoyable as reading [The Hitchhiker's Guid the Galaxy][guide], which is very much enjoyable. So if you ever want to know what's the best way to [Destroy the Web][destroy], talk to this guy.

Garret Smith, whom I used to know only by his blogs and tweets, gave the most inspiring talk I have seen in a while about how software has a more in common with an organism than a structure and that in order to write good software, first we need to accept that we're not gods and can't plan everything. It's the same school of thoughts as Hintjens' [Living Systems][living] and [The Lean Startup][lean]. Both which I became a big fan of recently.

Since Rome in springtime is said to be especially beautifull I arrived a day earlier which I spent walking around the litterally the whole city, enjoying the sun and eating plenty of gelato. Of course I visited the [Vittorio II Monument][vittorio], walked along the Foro Romano to he Coloseum and took a nap in the Circo Maximo. Then I strolled to the [Tiber island][tiber_isle] and through the inner city to the Vatican where they already prepared for the [Easter Mass][st_pauls]. I also visited the park of Villa Borghese which I requires a little climb but the view from [Pincio][pincio] is definitely worth it. But the best part of the whole trip was definitely the food. Simply incredible.
