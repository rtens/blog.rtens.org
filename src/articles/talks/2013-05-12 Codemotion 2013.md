Last Friday I had the pleasure of talking about Template Animation and my [implementation] of it at [codemotion] Berlin. You can find the slides [here]. Being my first talk at a conference it was quite an adventure and big fun.

Although some talks inevitably turned out to be of the tutorial-read-out-loud kind, most presentations were very enjoyable and informative, most notably the ones of [Vicent Martí], [Garrett Smith] and [Mike Benkovich].

Vincent proved his mom wrong by presenting how github mastered the unique challenges of scaling a code hosting platform. Unfortunately, the room didn't scale that well but I found my seat in a turned-over litter bin. 

In the Saturday morning session, Garrett showed in a fresh and to-the-point presentation how software can be developed using his highly adaptive anti-method "drunken stumble" - you don't need be agile, turtles are successful too.

And with the speed and precision of a magician, Mike pulled four interconnected applications for four different platforms out of his azure hat in an impressive live-coding session.

And it couldn't have been topped-off better than by the github [Drinkup] yesterday night at the Golgatha Biergarten where I met some very cool people and my new favorite [beer]. My thanks go out to github for the awesome evening and for making all of our coding lives less a pain in the ass.
