Last weekend I had the pleasure of talking about Specification by Example at the [Free and Open Source Software Conference][froscon] near Bonn. [You can find the commented slides about Specification by Example here][slides]. If you watched the talk, I would appreciate your feedback [here][feedback].

I used the opportunity to finally get in touch with LISP and its relatives and got quite intrigued by Moritz Heidkamp [view on the world][worldview] promoting s-expressions to be used as syntax for everything including HTML, CSS and SQL. I instantly became a fan of the regular syntax.

But I was brought down to the cruel reality again when I was trying to actually build something at the [Clojure workshop][clojurews]. The goal was to implement the [Game of Life][gol] and I failed miserably in wrapping my head around the everything-as-a-function way of thinking. Also, I spent most of the time getting the test runner to work in order to do proper TDD which seems to be a veeery unusual approach in the Lisp/Clojure world. But in the end I could run a test suite without restarting the JVM (which took almost a minute on my Atom) so I count that as a success.

My first session of the PHP subconference was a talk about our awesome architecture at ResearchGate, [marrying frontend and backend][wedding] given by my colleagues [Bastian] and [Volker]. I owe quite a bit to Volker for it was him who suggested to me to talk at conferences after I talked at the PHP user group a couple of times.

Saturday's last session for me was [Liane Thönnes][liane] and Tim Schneider talking about cats and dogs aka [Designers and Developers][catsanddogs], their differences, their misunderstandings and their similarities. The talk was very entertaining and inspiring and strengthened my opinion that a lot of wasted time can be avoided by integrating designer into the development team.

The rest of the evening I took the opportunity to get to know the attending part of the PHP community which resulted in a great night with very enjoyable and interesting conversations with a lot of Kölsch. Since the BBQ took a while to arrive and then had a queue of at least 100m I declared Kölsch and Pfeffi as my dinner. I was even taught the "Hallemann" (Hollamann?) as tricky way to enjoy both at the same time. In short, I had an exquisit time and was very happy to have the last slot on Sunday.
