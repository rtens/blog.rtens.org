My first conference of 2017 brought me to my new favourite city, Amsterdam. There is very litte beating sitting at the canals on a warm May evening with a cold beer and good conversations.

So thanks to Codemotion for yet again organizing an excellent event and giving me the opportunity to talk about Template Animation. It was very interesting to explore what has changed since I talked about this topic [four years earlier] (almost to the day) at my very first conference, which was also Codemotion, in Berlin.
