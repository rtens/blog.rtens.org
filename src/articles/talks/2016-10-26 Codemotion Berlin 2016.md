To get to this month's conference I didn't need plane nor train but could easily walk the couple of hundred meters to [Codemotion] in the Kulturbrauerei. And not only that was new but also my talk on *Prototyping with Domain-Driven Design*. You can find the [slides here].

The factory-atmosphere of the place was typically Berlin and the whole event was very well organized. I'm already looking forward to [Milan] next month.
