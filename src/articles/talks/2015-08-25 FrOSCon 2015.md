Last weekend, it was the 10 years anniversary of [FrOSCon] and I got the chance to present "The pyramid is a lie" - a talk about multi-level testing inspired by [Konstantin Kudryashov][everzet]'s talk [Modelling by Example]. [You can find the slides here][slides] and you can [rate the talk here][joindin].

As last year, the conference was a blast and very well organized. I'm especially happy that [Maximilian Berghoff] took the opportunity to treat the subject in [his blog]. And thanks for your [feedback]. Can't wait for next year.
